# 2011 Italian Enumeration Area Classification

Still very much a work in progress! :sweat_smile:

## So far...

- Download the census data
    - See scripts in the data folder of the repo
- Prepare the data for the classification
    - [Census variables aggregation and transformation](100-prep/101-census-data-2011-transformation.html)
    - [Census variables selection](100-prep/111-classification-variable-selection.html)
- Clustering
    - [Determine the number of clusters](200-clustering/201-number-of-clusters.html)
    - [First attempt at enumeration areas clustering](200-clustering/221-clustering-k08.html)
- Results
    - Coming soon...
        


## Reproducibility

All the code is available in the [2011-IEAC repository](https://github.com/sdesabbata/2011-IEAC) and it was compiled using the [sdesabbata/r-for-2011-ieac docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sdesabbata/r-for-2011-ieac).
