    - [Census variables selection](100-prep/111-classification-variable-selection.html)
- Clustering
    - [Determine the number of clusters](200-clustering/201-number-of-clusters.html)
    - [First attempt at enumeration areas clustering](200-clustering/211-clustering-k08.html)
- Result
    - Check out the [Shiny interactive map demo for Friuli-Venezia Giulia](https://sdesabbata.shinyapps.io/ieac-v0_0_3-map-fvg/)
